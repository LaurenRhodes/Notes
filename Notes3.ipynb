    " * Write a function that prints the primes less than 100. Use for loops rather than while loops.\n",
    " * Write a function that given an integer prints out its prime factors. Use for loops rather than while loops.\n",
    " * Write a function that given 2 integers prints out their highest common factor\n",
    " * Write a function that given 2 integers prints out their lowest common denominator\n",
    " * Pick a number. If it's even, divide by 2. If it's odd multiply by 3 and add 1. Continue this until you reach 1. E.g. if you start with 3, the sequence will be 3-10-5-16-8-4-2-1. Write a program to find out which integer less than 100 produces the longest chain.\n",
    " * Ask the user to type an integer in the range 1 to 7. If the user types something invalid, ask them to try again. Then print the day of the week corresponding to the number - print \"Sunday\" if the user types 1, etc.\n",
    " * The zeta function, zeta(s), can be evaluated by summing terms of the form 1/is for i running from 1 to infinity. It can also be evaluated by multiplying terms of the form (1/(1-1/ps)) where p runs through all the primes. See how true this is for series of 10 terms then 100 terms.\n",
    " * Simulate a situation where you keep asking different people their birthdays until you find 2 people with the same birthday. Assume all years have 365 days. Make the code into a function so that you can run it many times and find an average for the number of people you need to ask.\n",
    " * Big numbers are often printed with commas after every 3 digits - e.g. 1,345,197. Write a function which is given a float and prints out the number with commas. You'll need to find out how to convert numbers to strings - use the WWW!\n",
    " * Create a list to represent an 8x8 chessboard. In chess a Bishop can move as far as it likes along diagonals. Write a program to count the number of places a Bishop can move to for a particular starting position. From which starting positions does it have the greatest choice of moves?\n",
    " * In chess, a knight moves in an 'L' shape (2 squares along a row or column, then one square left or right). Write a program to count the number of places a Knight can move to for a particular starting position.\n",
    " * Starting at any square on a chessboard, move the knight randomly, and keep moving until it lands on a square it's already visited. How many moves does it do on average?\n"
